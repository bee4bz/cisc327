***** Running Scripts *****

***** dailyScript.sh *****
The daily script takes one parameter, day number of the week. it can accept 1->5
ex.
./dailyScript.sh 1

It can sometimes work without a  parameter, but also sometimes not. I  recommend to default to 1.


***** weeklyTest.sh *****
This script is simple. It is run by just calling it. There are no parameters ex.
./weeklyTest.sh

it is just a simple loop that calls the dailyScript.sh with a number parameter
